            <p>The hangman game is a game that you will guess a word with letters.</p>
            <p>Letters will be presented in boxes on the screen. You can then click on the boxes to guess.</p>
            <p>If you get a letter in the word, the letter you guessed will be presented on one or several lines, which the amount of the lines is the word length.</p>
            <p>You will have up to 10 times to guess.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of words would vary as well. After you guess wrong each time, the parts of the man and the stand will appear, when all parts appear, you lose the game!</p>
            <p>Good Luck!</p>
